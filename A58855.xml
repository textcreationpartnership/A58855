            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Sir William Scrogg HIS SPEECH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the King's Favour is the effect of the duty I have paid Him, (which your Lordſhip is pleas'd to call Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) is the moſt welcome and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing part of His kindneſs; and I truſt We ſhall ſtill ſee ſuch times, that no man ſhall hope to have it, or keep it on any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The right application of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is the ſteady Juſtice of a Nation; where, though the Rewards of Kings exceed what a Subject can merit, they ſhould never reach him that demerits. To return Good for Evil may be an obligation of Charity; It is never of Bounty. And the taking off (as they call it) of an Ambitious, and therefore a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious man, by Favours, is the worſt way to ſtop or open his mouth; for he will whiſper one way louder, than he will ſpeak the other: And when you think you gain one Enemy, you make many.</p>
            <p>On ſuch an occaſion as this, I think it very proper to give your Lordſhip ſome account, what conſiderations I have had, in order to the diſcharge of my duty in this place, ſince the King's firſt intimations of His pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And that reſpects Matters, either as they ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his People, or betwixt Man and Man.</p>
            <p>For the firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50735:3"/>I know that the Law gives ſuch Prerogatives to the King, that to endeavour more were to deſire worſe; and it gives to the People ſuch Liberties, that more would be licentious.</p>
            <p>What then hath a man to do that hath Courage enough to be honeſt, but to apply his Underſtanding to the Miniſtration of thoſe Laws juſtly to both: Wherein I may ſay, that the Caſes will be rare that will be difficult in themſelves. They may be made ſo from ſiniſter Cauſes; when men thinking to ſerve a Turn, or like <hi>Pilate,</hi> to pleaſe the People, deliver up that which is right to be crucified. Then they are fain to rack their Fancies to make good their Faults. This makes ſuch nice Diſtinctions, and ſuch ſtrained Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, till they leave nothing plain in the world. Whereas in truth, the Duty we owe to the King and his People, is like the Duty we owe to God, not hard to underſtand, whatever it is to practice.</p>
            <p>This Court, my Lord, 'tis true, is properly a Court of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> where Prerogative and Liberty are ſeldom Plaintiffs or Defendants. But yet 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that even in private Cauſes, matter of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many times intervenes, and the Publick is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by Conſequence. And therefore I think it fair, and like Engliſh honeſty and plainneſs, ſomething to unveil one's ſelf in that particular, that men may know before-hand what they may expect. And herein I do declare, I would no more wrong or leſſen the People's Liberties, than I would ſacrifice up my Son. But then I will no more derogate from the King's Prerogative, than I would betray my Father.</p>
            <p>My Lord, In times when Faction is ſo bold as to be bare-fac'd; and falſe and ſeditious News is openly talk'd, and greedily embrac'd; when the King's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Demands are diſputed, and turned into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and thoſe that oppoſe 'em talke confidently; and thoſe that ſhould maintain 'em ſpeak fearfully and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; when the Reverence we owe to the King is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50735:3"/>
paid to the People; the Government is beſet, the King is in danger, and there is nothing wanting but oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>But when to prevent that opportunity, men are afraid, and hold it dangerous to avoid the danger; when we dare not call a Crime by its right name; and for ſome, find none; and a Miſchief muſt be effected, before we will think it one: When dangerous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts are minc'd, and by ſome trivial difference Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is diſtinguiſh'd into a Treſpaſs; when men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and venturous enough in what thwarts the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but in ſupporting it ſeem grave and cautious, nice and timerous, and ſo fill'd with Prudentials, till they are as wiſe as fear can make 'em; The Law is enervated, and becomes uſeleſs to its greateſt end, which is, the preſervation of the whole.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, in Publick Cauſes, the ſame Integrity is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as in Private; But that is but part of a Judge's Duty. He muſt be Magnanimous as well as Virtuous. And I acknowledge it to be a main and principal part of my duty, as it relates to the King and his People, with hearty reſolution to ſuppreſs all open Force, and private Confederacies; not thinking any thing little that attempts the Publick Safety; for when the Motives are ſmall, the Danger is greater; when Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents exceed their Cauſes.</p>
            <p>And for the diſcharge of my Duty betwixt Party and Party, it is impoſſible to be performed without thoſe two Cardinal Virtues, [Temper] and [Cleanneſs of Hands] Temper comprehends Patience, Humility, and Candor. It ſeems to me that ſaying, <hi>Be quick to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> was made on purpoſe for a Judge. No Direction can be apter, and no Character becomes him better: and he that would not be ſaid to have but one Ear, me-thinks ſhould be aſham'd to have none. And I appeal to your Lordſhips experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if a patient Attention, accompanied with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parts, and a competency in the Law, with a mind
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50735:4"/>
fairly diſpoſed for Information or Conviction, will not, as to uſe and common benefit, exceed the profoundeſt Knowledge, and moſt towering Underſtanding, that is attended with an impetuous haſte, either out of a glory of Speaking, or too great a fulneſs of himſelf.</p>
            <p>And for Humility, Though I will not ſay that every Impatient Man is proud, (becauſe that may ariſe from other cauſes) yet every Proud Man is impatient, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Information, always of Contradiction; and he muſt be violent to maintain his own Imperiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Harſhneſs is a needleſs and unbecoming Provocation: It makes Men hate where they ſhould fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: And yet by Gentleneſs I underſtand, not Tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but Moderation; not without Rebukes, but without Taunts.</p>
            <p>For Corruption, that Perverter of Law and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Property, that leaves in the World nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bonum</hi> nor <hi>AEquum;</hi> for when he does Right, he does not Juſtice; and he that ſells Juſtice, will ſell In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. 'Tis not only to be avoided, but abhorred; and not alone in its direct Approaches, but in Relatives and Servants, thoſe By-ways of Bribery; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes every Man ſo manifeſtly to deteſt it, that it may ſcare even the attempt: for no Man is ſufficiently ſafe unleſs to his power he avoids the ſuſpicion as well as the fault. Practice does one; and that which makes me ſpeak this, a publick Profeſſion againſt it, is the way to do the other.</p>
            <p>And where Gifts prevail not; yet if Fear, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Popularity ſway, 'tis the ſame thing. If there be a Byaſs put to a Man, it matters not of what 'tis made. Nay, theſe are worſe than Corruption by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for there both ſides may have the ſame Tools, when a Man cannot make himſelf a Kin, nor his Cauſe Popular.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave, My Lord, to ſhew why I thought it fit, nay extreamly neceſſary to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing on the Particulars I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50735:4"/>Firſt, To ſatisfie your Lordſhip and the World I undertake not this Place without due Conſiderations of the Duty belongs to it. Next, It is ſome Tye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man not to commit thoſe Errours he hath in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick declaimed againſt: for he muſt add Impudence to his Crime, to have his own words fly in his face, with which every Man will upbraid, and no Man can excuſe him.</p>
            <p>My Lord, In a Diſcourſe on ſuch an Occaſion as this, where Men are concern'd in Point of Intereſt, (for ſo they are when a Judge is made) my Aim is not to ſay what will pleaſe their Humours, but what ſhould ſatisfie their Minds: Neither am I ſo vain as to think I ſhall do that with all; nor much concerned though it fall out ſo. If Reputation and a Good Name can be got by doing my Duty, 'tis welcome; but if it muſt be ſought by other Arts, I will be no Seeker; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that the Applauſe of the Multitude, that Contingent Judge of Good and Bad, rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Vain than the Vertuous; and is oftner ſought by ſuch too. The Approbation of the Wiſe, which are the Few; and of the Honeſt, by which I intend, Men heartily affected to the Government, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I earneſtly covet: For them that are otherwiſe, I court not their good opinion, becauſe I fear not their bad; and would not draw that ſuſpicion upon my ſelf, that Men may ſay, What Ill has he done, that thoſe Men ſpeak ſo well of him? I never was of their Party, nor never will be. And to be even with them, I think as meanly of them as they do of Loyalty; whoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes are more to be eſteemed than their Triumphs. The good words of ſuch as truly love their Country, (which no Man ever did that does not love his Prince) indeed I highly prize, and will endeavour to deſerve; though your Lordſhip at this time has been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with me in that Particular, by beſtowing them upon me firſt; and ſo many, that I am aſhamed I have been no better to have made 'em good: But becauſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50735:5"/>
your Lordſhip is willing and able to render any Man much better than he is, they ought to be eſteemed as the Proceed of a Generous Nature, and an Indulgent Prudence; which by telling me what I am, does but kindly inſinuate what I ſhould be.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I will waſte no more of your time, though I omit thoſe uſual Returns of formal Thanks; for they are of courſe; or extream wondring at the great Surprizals of the Kings Favour; and thoſe humble, yet high Debaſements of ones Self, which look like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, but is a ſort of Bravery.</p>
            <p>My Thanks ſhall be paid in (what the KING likes beſt) Service to His People. The Wonder will ceaſe by that time I get to the Bench: And my Defects are beſt confeſt by endeavouring to amend them.</p>
